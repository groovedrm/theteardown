This is my first post on The Teardown. Let's test all the formatting options.

## Code Example

Here's some inline `code` and a code block:

```python
def hello():
    return "Hello, world!"
```

## Blockquote Example

> This is a blockquote that will show up with the orange bar on the left side.
> It can span multiple lines.

## Lists

* First item with some longer text to show how wrapping works
* Second item
* Third item with a [link](#)

## Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote content.

That's all for now!
